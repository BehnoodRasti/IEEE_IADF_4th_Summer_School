Self-Supervised Learning for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
A Comprehensive Tutorial on MAE Pre-training and Downstream Tasks

Overview
An introduction self-supervised learning techniques for hyperspectral imagery using the Spectral Earth dataset. We'll explore:

Hyperspectral Data - We will use data from the Spectral Earth dataset sourced from EnMAP - Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program. The full SpectralEarth dataset can be retrieved from the DLR Geoservices Portal
MAE Pre-training - Masked Autoencoder implementation for self-supervised learning
Downstream Tasks - Fine-tuning for crop classification with labels from EuroCrops
For this purpose, we will rely on the following libraries and frameworks:

Code & Tools
Spectral Earth Repository - Pre-trained models, data and code
PyTorch Lightning - A framework on top of PyTorch
Lightly SSL - A SSL for Computer Vision library
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning
Familiarity with PyTorch
Some exposure to computer vision and remote sensing concepts
